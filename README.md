# ComingSoon

Coming Soon is a web application that allows users to search for movies in a browser and view a description and rating for the film.

## Setting up your developer environment

First make sure the following are installed:
<ul><li>Git</li>
<li>Node.js</li>
<li>Angular and Angular CLI</li>
<li>DotNET SDK</li>
<li>ng packagr (npm install -D ng-packagr)</li></ul>

Use PowerShell running as an administrator to install these.

## Running the application

*To run the application locally*

<ol><li>Clone the Coming Soon repository to your local machine.</li>
<ol><li>Open a terminal, for example GitBash, in the folder you would like as your working location.</li> 
<li>Run git clone <repo url>.</li></ol>
The repo will be copied into the folder.
<li>Install dependencies.</li>
<ol><li>In the ComingSoon folder, run npm install.</li></ol>
You will see that a new folder called “node modules” and a file called “package-lock.json” have been added to your local repo.
<li>Run npm run start</li>
<li>Navigate to http://localhost:4200/</li></ol>

If any of these steps fail, refer to the Troubleshooting section in the Coming Soon section of the OPSI Knowledgebase.
